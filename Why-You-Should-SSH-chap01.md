# Why-You-Should-SSH-chap01

SSH is a protocol to encrypt connection.
Connection is everywhere in digital life.
We need to operate computer remotely.
We need to call somebody remotely.
If we want to do something remotely such as commucation, then SSH can be used to protect our info security.

SSH tech is not different with password, both are used for protect something we want it to be secret.
But from technical perspective, SSH takes public key encryption, which is more safe and convenient than password verification.
